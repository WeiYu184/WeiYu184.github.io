For block adjustment with few ground-control points or without ground control, the vertical error of the model is the decisive factor that constrains the accuracy of 3D data products. The elevation data obtained by spaceborne laser altimeter have the advantages of short update periods, high positioning precision, and low acquisition cost, providing sufficient data support for improving the elevation accuracy of stereo models through the combined BA. This paper proposes a geometric positioning model based on the integration of optical satellite stereo imagery (OSSI) and spaceborne laser altimeter data, while illustrating the four key technologies’ implementation algorithms. Firstly, we elaborate the principle and necessity of this work through a literature review of existing methods. Then, the framework of our geo-positioning models integrating OSSI and satellite-based laser control points is illustrated. Secondly, four key technologies of the proposed model are expounded in order, including the acquisition and management of global laser control points, the association of laser control points and OSSI, the block adjustment model combining laser control points with OSSI, and the accuracy estimation and quality control of the combined BA. Next, the combined BA experiment using Ziyuan-3 (ZY-3) satellite three-linear-array optical stereo imagery and ICESat-2 laser data was carried out at the testing site in Shandong Province, China. Experimental results prove that our method can automatically select laser control points with high accuracy. The elevation deviation of the combined BA eventually achieved the mean error (ME) of 0.06 m and the root mean square error (RMSE) of 1.18 m, much lower than the ME of 13.20 m and the RMSE of 3.88 m before the block adjustment. Finally, the conclusion and prospect of our study are given. The assistance of ICESat-2 laser data has significantly improved the elevation accuracy of optical stereo images. A further research direction will be how to perform more adequate accuracy analysis and quality control using massive laser points as checkpoints. Considering the complexity of the global terrain, designing an algorithm that is adaptive to terrain undulations for the association of laser control points with optical stereo models is a possible improvement of our work.</p><h3 id="Keywords"><a href="#Keywords" class="headerlink" title="Keywords"></a>Keywords</h3><p>Spaceborne laser altimeter; ICESat-2; optical stereo imagery; ZY-3; combined block adjustment; block adjustment without ground control; geometric positioning; stereo mapping</p>]]></content>

Based on ICESat-2 &#x2F;ATLAS global laser data product ATL08, this paper obtained ICESat-2 laser points on the global land, and studied the method of extracting global elevation control points based on elevation reference and attribute parameters, and used reference elevation data to verify their accuracy. The obtained laser points were verified by airborne laser data in Shandong experimental field and Henan experimental field in China. And the root mean square error (RMSE) were 1.11 m and 1.39 m respectively before filtering. After filtering with elevation reference and slope constraints, the mean RMSE were 0.69 m and 0.57 m respectively, and the corresponding data retention rates were 61.38% and 60.00%, which proved that the proposed method in this paper could effectively improve the elevation accuracy while ensuring the data retention rate. The airborne laser data from the western, central and eastern United States experimental fields were used to verify the elevation control points. The RMSE of each experimental field was less than 0.9 m, which proved that the extraction method proposed in this paper could be used to extract elevation control points worldwide. This method can automatically extract global elevation control points with high density and high precision, providing support for the stereo mapping of domestic high-resolution satellites without or with few ground control points, and assistance in evaluating the quality of DEM&#x2F;DSM products.</p><h3 id="Keywords"><a href="#Keywords" class="headerlink" title="Keywords"></a>Keywords</h3><p> ATLAS,  spaceborne laser altimeter,  ICESat-2,  global elevation control points</p><p>More infor, <a href="http://ch.whu.edu.cn/en/article/doi/10.13203/j.whugis20200531">http://ch.whu.edu.cn/en/article/doi/10.13203/j.whugis20200531</a></p>]]></content>
